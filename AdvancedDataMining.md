# What is Data Mining?
## Data Mining
- Generalization (summarization)
- Frequent Patterns (association & correlation)
- Classification
- Cluster Analysis
- Outlier Analysis

## Structured Data
- We want fewer columns (attributes) but lots of rows (data objects) for data mining

## Curse of Dimensionality
- By the time our number of dimensions is 4 or more, the probability distribution can no longer be represented by a normal curve.
- Data becomes sparse

This can be solved using Sampling or Trimming techniques
